                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p> <img src="/images/TessaJohn_Nov2022-3.jpg" style="object-fit: scale-down; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px" /></p>
                <p><b>How we met:</b> Our story began in Chicago during the seemingly inauspicious year of 2020. John landed in the Windy City to explore fintec jobs following college whereas Tessa flew in and out of the city regularly as a MDW-based flight attendant. Desperate for human contact following the Covid-19 lockdown, we resorted to the wild world of online dating. Since the world was shut down and formal dates were out of the question, John made each of Tessa’s visits to Chicago special. Through John’s newfound work-from-home lifestyle and Tessa’s potentially “turbulent” time in the airline industry (i.e., furlough threats), we managed to find safety in one another and a lifetime of love to boot.</p>
                <p><b>Our proposal:</b> On September 2, 2022, Tessa and John witnessed the reunion of John’s parents and had the honor of being members of their wedding party. After diligent planning with his parents, John proposed under full spotlight at the reception. In front of his friends, family, and (what felt like) everyone, Tessa said yes!</p>
